# Discover Live Music

For this project we wanted to create a website where you could search for concerts by artist or by your area. Within the app there is a user-friendly interface where you can select to search by artist or area. We ran into some issues in the beginning with the spotify API but we were able to over come that obsticle. In the end our app calls 2 API's (Seatgeek and Spotify) to make the app run perfectly.
